# Reinforcement_LR_Mountain_Car

Implemented a Q-learning with linear function approximation to solve
the mountain car environment. Implemented functions to initialize, train,
evaluate, and obtain the optimal policies and action values with Q-learning.

This repo is part of my CMU 10601 homework. 
Note for CMU students: Please do not copy this code. You will get by the Autolab algorithms and fail the course
